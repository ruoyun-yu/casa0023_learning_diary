    "text": "4.2 Application\nRemote sensing imagery plays a crucial role in supporting urban green infrastructure planning and policy responses. For example, it can be used to quantify urban forest structure, providing governments with accurate data support. The study 《Quantifying urban forest structure with open-access remote sensing data sets》uses a random forest approach to train the model and apply it to urban forest structure assessment. It first calculates canopy cover, canopy height, and tree density using LiDAR data from the UK Environment Agency. Then, it incorporates Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate, and terrain data, which are preprocessed via Google Earth Engine. The random forest model predicts forest structure indicators and is applied at both 100m and 20m grid scales. Additionally, the study validates the model’s accuracy using iTree Eco data and explores its transferability across different urban environments.\n\nMoreover, remote sensing can identify potential areas for urban tree planting, assess the economic benefits of green infrastructure development, and provide data-driven support for optimizing urban green space layouts. The study《Efficient assessments of urban tree planting potential within or near the southern Piedmont region of the United States》employs supervised classification to analyze remote sensing imagery, categorizing land into four classes: water, developed land, open land, and forest. Using NAIP imagery as reference data, the study validates classification accuracy through random sampling. When evaluating suitable planting areas, it excludes obstacles such as buildings, roads, and water bodies, as well as small forest gaps. The proportion of plantable land within open spaces is calculated for each city. For other cities, the study applies the same classification method to identify open areas and estimates total tree planting potential by extrapolating from similar urban areas.\nThese studies demonstrate that remote sensing technology can provide efficient and accurate data support, enabling governments to develop more informed urban green space plans, optimize green infrastructure layouts, and assess their environmental and economic benefits."
