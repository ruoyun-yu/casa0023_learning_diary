## **Personal Introduction**

My name is Ruoyun üòä, and I am a student in the MSc Urban Spatial Science program at CASA. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in Human Geography and Urban-Rural Planning. Throughout my studies, I participated in research on ecosystem service valuation, urban land use change, and urban village regeneration. Through my involvement in these research projects, I recognized the value of remote sensing imagery while also identifying some limitations in open-source, second-hand remote sensing data, such as misclassification and low accuracy. This motivated me to deepen my understanding of remote sensing analysis, enhance my data analysis skills, and build a solid foundation for future research.

The following pages contain my learning diary for the CASA0023 moduleüõ∞Ô∏è, including weekly summaries of course content, applications of remote sensing techniques, and my reflections.
